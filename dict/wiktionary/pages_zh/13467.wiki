===Etymology===
{{Han etyl}}
{{liushu|p}} – footprint (pointing down), variant of [[夊]]. Compare [[止]], which has similar form in oracle script, but has leg pointing up, and [[𡕒]] (as in right side of [[舛]], roughly [[ヰ]]), which also has leg pointing down, but toe pointing left, hence different evolutions.
