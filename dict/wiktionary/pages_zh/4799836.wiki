====Usage notes====
This term has legal ramifications under Japanese law. If a labor schedule ordinarily has an employee off on Sunday and at work on a Monday, and the schedule is changed so that the employee is working Sunday and off Monday instead, that Monday would be a {{lang|ja|振替休日}} (''furikae kyūjitsu''). Moreover, so long as the number of hours worked that week does not change, the employee's time on Sunday would be paid at the regular rate, and not at the legally stipulated higher rates for either overtime or holiday pay.
