===Etymology===
Compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=けんごろうぶな'|源五郎|tr1=Gengorō|t1=male given name|鮒|tr2=funa|t2=[[crucian carp]]}}. The ''funa'' changes to ''buna'' due to {{rendaku|けんごろうぶな'}}.

According to one theory, the ''Gengorō'' portion was the name of a fisherman who fished in [[w:Lake Biwa|Lake Biwa]], and every morning, presented the best of his catch of ''funa'' to the local lord. In another theory, this term arose from a tale about a Lake Biwa fisherman named ''Gengorō'', who fell in love with a noblewoman and arranged a secret meeting with her by hiding a note inside a ''gengorōbuna'' fish that he had caught and presented to her.

Like many [[biology]] terms, this word is often spelled in katakana, as {{l|ja|ゲンゴロウブナ}}.
