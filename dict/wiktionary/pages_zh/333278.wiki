#*:: ''A guy was taking his wife home after a night of drinking, when an empty taxicab in front of them saw a customer on the side of the road, and slammed on his breaks. The wife was not wearing a seatbelt, so her head slammed into the windshield, and she was hurt badly! The driver '''lost it''', and got out of the car along with his buddy, and started beating up the taxicab driver. They laid him out after only a few punches, but then a cop car came, so they split!''
