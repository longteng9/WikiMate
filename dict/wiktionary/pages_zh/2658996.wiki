====Usage notes====
This term was borrowed from biological terminology in 2003,<ref>http://gradworks.umi.com/14/68/1468502.html</ref> and widely used, especially by China's [[CCTV]] television channel, to refer to traditional music (and later also to dance, fashion, cuisine, architecture, tourism, etc.) that exists in a pristine, unmodernized form, relatively untouched by outside cultures. The term is used most frequently to refer to music and other traditions practiced by China's ethnic minorities, although it can also be used to refer to older traditions practiced by China's Han majority.
