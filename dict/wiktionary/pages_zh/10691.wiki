# {{lb|vi|colloquial}} [[he]], [[she]], [[it]]

====Usage notes====
* Chữ Nôm.
* This is the regular form of this character. The common form is [[奴]].
* The term is ''de facto'' used to refer to any animal (including the human) in the third person, in a disrespectful manner. The use of the term to translate the English ''it'', or to refer to an inanimate object, is rather artificial, and mostly found in awkward (but common) translation of other languages.
