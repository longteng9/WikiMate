===Etymology===
A variant of {{zh-l|㗎妹}} often used in electronic communications due to character encoding limitations, as the Cantonese-specific character {{zh-l|㗎}} does not show up properly on some computers. {{zh-l|㗎妹}} itself may itself be a variant of {{zh-l|嘎妹}}. The ultimate etymology of the first syllable "gaa4" (however written) is not clear; it may be onomatopoeia or mockery of the sound of the Japanese language, akin to the term [[barbarian]].
