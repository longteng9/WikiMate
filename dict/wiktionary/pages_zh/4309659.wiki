====Usage notes====
While ''writer'' and ''author'' can both be translated as {{zh-l|作家}} or {{zh-l|作者}} depending on the context, the former term can only refer to a writer who is relatively well-established, while the latter term can refer to any person who writes a text. {{zh-l|著者}} shares the same meaning as {{zh-l|作者}}. {{zh-l|筆者|tr=bǐzhě}} is usually used self-reflexively.
