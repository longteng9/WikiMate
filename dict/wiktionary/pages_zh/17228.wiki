===Etymology===
Newly coined character. {{Han compound|肉|alt1=⺼|元|ls=psc|c1=s|t1=body|c2=p|t2=original}}.

Modelled after the etymology of English "{{m|en|protein}}": from {{cog|grc|πρῶτος||first}} ― cf. {{zh-l|元|original, first}}, which also acted as the phonetic component of the character.

The choice of this character for the sense of "prion" is primarily due to the nature of prions as proteins, but might also have been influenced by the pronunciation of the word {{m|en|prion}}.
