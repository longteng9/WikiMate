===Etymology 2===
Alteration from ''Kōkuri''.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref> This usage developed after the two failed attempts in 1274 and 1281 to invade Japan by the combined forces of the [[Mongol]] [[w:Yuan Dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] and the [[Goryeo]] kingdom.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref> Goryeo was a successor kingdom to [[Goguryeo]], but in the popular Japanese language of the time, Goryeo was still referred to as {{lang|ja|高句麗}} (''Kōkuri'' or ''Kokuri'', i.e. “Goguryeo”) instead of {{m|ja|高麗|tr=Kōrai|pos=the Japanese reading of “Goryeo”}}.

The adverb {{m|ja|こくり|tr=kokuri||startedly, startlingly, (jumping up) suddenly}} likely derives from this usage.

*: Although ''kokuri'' and ''mokuri'' here are both written using the spellings for two proper nouns, in this phrase they are used as adverbs. This might be [[ateji]], or it might be that the adverbs developed from the proper nouns. Note that many other Japanese adverbs can end in ''-ri'', such as {{m|ja|ちょっぴり|tr=choppiri||slightly, a little bit-ly}}, {{m|ja|たっぷり|tr=tappuri||fully, adequately}}, or {{m|ja|ふらり|tr=furari||aimlessly, casually, unexpectedly}}.
