{{also|雖}}
==Translingual==

===Etymology===
{{liushu|p}}: a reptile, like [[虫]] but with a large head.

Originally referred to a type of reptile. The character was later borrowed for a more abstract word and a [[隹]] phonetic added, producing the traditional form [[雖]]. The simplified form removes 隹.
