===Etymology===
literraly ''Ying writes a letter and Yan reads it''. This idiom come from an annecdote told by Han Fei ({{zh-l|韓非}}). A man from Ying ({{zh-l|郢}}) in the state of Chu ({{zh-l|楚}}) was writing a letter to the minister of Yan ({{zh-l|燕}}). As he was wrinting at night, he ordered to "''Raise the light.''" but he accidentally wrote what he said. When the minister of Yan received the letter, he interpreted "''Raise the light''" as "''Honor the enlightened.''" or "''Promote the worthy and employ them.''" which led to the regulation of the state of Chu.
