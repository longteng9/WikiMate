{{zh-forms|s=扬子江}}

===Etymology===
From {{zh-l|揚子}} (for "[[Yangzhou]]" directly or for a nearby ferry named "[[Yangzi]]") + {{zh-l|江|(major) river}}. Its false etymology as "Son of the Ocean" stems from the homophonic misnomer {{zh-l|[[洋]][[子]][[江]]}}.

===Proper noun===

# {{lb|zh|obsolete}} the stretch of the [[Yangtze]] River between its mouth and [[Nanjing]], near the formerly-important port of [[Yangzhou]]
# [[w:Yangtze River|Yangtze River]]

====Usage notes====
In Chinese, the name {{zh-l|長江}} is overwhelmingly more common. To the extent 揚子江 is employed in modern usage, it is typically translating names or phrases from foreign languages, where variations on it became standard for the entire river.
