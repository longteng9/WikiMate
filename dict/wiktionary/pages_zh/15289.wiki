===Etymology 1===
<!-- Technically, the two pronunciations/readings here should be split into separate etyls -- "o" from JA, "go" from ZHO -- but that would make the usage note confusing. -->

====Prefix====
{{ja-pos|prefix|お|ご}}

# Prefix indicating that the word is honorific. Often used to indicate that the word belongs or is related to the listener (as opposed to the speaker).

=====Usage notes=====
This prefix is frequently written in hiragana, both because it is complicated and common, and because its reading may be ambiguous if the term is unfamiliar. When the prefix is read as ''o-'' (as opposed to ''go-''), it is almost exclusively written in hiragana.

While in general this prefix is optional, in many cases it is so commonly used that the base word can no longer be used in isolation, as in [[御飯]] (ごはん, gohan, rice) – the form ×飯 *''han'' is not used alone, though it can be used as parts of compounds (such as [[炊飯]], ''suihan''), and the character can be read in isolation as ''meshi''.

Usage varies between speakers, situations, and sex – more polite speech, especially by women, features more use of this prefix, while blunt speech, especially by men, uses it less or not at all (words where the prefix has become mandatory are replaced by blunter terms that do not have the prefix). In rare cases a prefixed term has become impolite, as in {{m|ja|御前|tr=omae||you (familiar or derogatory)}}.

This character is generally read as お (o-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Japanese origin, as in [[御水]] (おみず, ''omizu'', ''water''), and ご (go-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Chinese origin, as in [[御主人]] (ごしゅじん, ''goshujin'', ''husband''). There are numerous exceptions, however, such as [[お電話]]. For (non-Chinese) foreign loan words ([[外来語]], [[gairaigo]]), this prefix is seldom used, and both お- and ご- may be used, but お- is somewhat preferred, as in [[おビール]] (''o-bīru'') for beer.

In some rare cases, it is pronounced み (''mi-''), primarily for religious words, pertaining to gods or the emperor, as in [[御輿]] (''mikoshi,'' a type of shrine). However, in this context it is often replaced by [[神]] ("god", also pronounced ''mi-''), and then a further 御 (pronounced お, ''o-'') may be added, as in [[御神輿]] (''o-mi-koshi''). The ''mi-'' prefix also became merged into other kanji, as in [[宮]] (''miya,'' imperial palace).

In rare cases, this is used as a suffix instead, notably in [[甥御]] ''oigo'' and [[姪御]] ''meigo'' (your nephew, your niece).

御 (お, ''o-'') should not be confused with [[大]] (おお, ''ō-,'' great), which is a less-commonly used prefix.

See [[w:Honorific speech in Japanese#Honorific prefixes|Honorific prefixes in Japanese]] for further discussion.

===Etymology 2===
From {{etyl|ojp|ja|sort=み}}. Cognate with {{l|ja|霊}} / {{m|ja|神|tr=mi||spirit, god}}, as this prefix was originally used to refer to gods and other spiritually important things.

====Prefix====
{{ja-pos|prefix|み|rom=mi}}

# Honorific prefix added to gods and other spiritually important things. Also added to other nouns to indicate godlike respect.
# Added to place names to emphasize beauty. (This usage is more often written in hiragana)
