===Etymology===
Literally: sweat and the color green. In Ancient China, before the paper was invented, writing was recorded on rectangular tablets made from either wood or bamboo called slips. The bamboo chosen for this purpose was usually green. It was put through a dehydration process that 'sweated out' the moisture from it making it more suitable for writing as well as for warding out insects and keeping it dry.
