===Etymology===
Originally a localism from Northern China, meaning "energetic, forceful; exciting, interesting". Allegedly popularized by a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH58ToOOPtE viral fandub video] of an episode from the Japanese anime ''{{w|Gag Manga Biyori}}''. In the episode "''{{w|Saiyūki}}'': The end of the journey", one peculiar line was "{{lang|zh|这就是天竺么？不给力啊[[老师|老湿]]！}}" ("This is India? This is not exciting at all, teacher."), uttered by {{w|Sun Wukong}} after discovering that, in the supposedly sacred place of {{w|Tenjiku|Tianzhu}} they had arrived at, there was only a small streamer with the two characters for "Tianzhu" written on it.

Etymology from other Chinese dialects, for example Min Nan "{{lang|nan|kik-làt}}" ("to exert oneself") or Hainan Lingao dialect {{lang|zh|给力}} ("to provide with force, to beat"), may also be possible.
