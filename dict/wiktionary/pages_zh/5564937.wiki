==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=咸鱼翻身|type=22}}

===Etymology===
From {{zh-l|[[鹹魚]][[返生]]|tr=haam4 jyu4-2 faan1 saang1}}, originally a {{etyl|yue|cmn}} fishermen's saying, literally "the salted fish becomes alive again".

The Cantonese-specific word {{zh-l|返生|tr=faan1 saang1|to be brought back to life}} was changed to the similar-sounding word {{zh-l|翻身|to turn over the body}} when it spread to other varieties of Chinese. Hence this seemingly paradoxical saying ("salted fish turns its body over").
