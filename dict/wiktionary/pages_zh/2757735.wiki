{{zh-forms}}

===Etymology===
Attested as early as Late Middle Chinese, with {{zh-l|每}} functioning as a meaningless particle. At that time, {{lang|zh|你每}} was an equilibrating disyllabic version of the emerging 2nd. sg. and pl. pronoun {{zh-l|您}}. During Yuan Dynasty, the creolisation of Mongolian and Northern Chinese to form the [[w:Han'er language|Han'er language]] resulted in immoderate usage expansion of the plural suffix -{{lang|zh|每}}, by analogy with Mongolian noun plural suffixes {{l|mn|-ууд}}, {{l|mn|-чууд}}, {{l|mn|-д}}, {{l|mn|нар}}. After the overthrow of the Yuan Dynasty and the decreolisation of Han'er, {{lang|zh|你每}} gradually developed into the present-day 2nd. pl. pronoun {{zh-l|你們}}. The origin of the suffix -{{lang|zh|每}} is unclear, perhaps also an Altaic influence. See {{zh-l|您}}.
