Compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=たいこんやくしゃ'|大根|tr1=daikon|t1=Chinese radish|役者|tr2=yakusha|t2=actor}}.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>

Derivation unknown. Possibly from the way that daikon as a food may be considered [[unsophisticated]] and [[crude]]; from the way that daikon are white ({{ja-l|白い}} {{ja-l|||shiroi}}), alluding to the term {{m|ja|素人|tr=shirōto||amateur; hack}}; or from a well-known [[witticism]] that no matter how much daikon one eats, it never causes food poisoning / is worth notice (hinging upon the verb {{ja-l|当たる||ataru}}, meaning either “to hit the mark” / “to be worth notice”, or “to cause food poisoning”).<ref name="DJR"/>
