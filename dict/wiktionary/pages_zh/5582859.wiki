====Usage notes====
In the second sense especially, this term is often translated into English as the truncated version ''tenko'' ({{m|ja|転呼}}) and translated as "change of call," which is a more literal, although slightly misleading, interpretation of the the characters ({{m|ja|転}} ''ten'' "change/alteration of a word," {{m|ja|呼}} ''ko'' "to call").
