===Etymology===
Literally: nine (in the) fifth (position)
: [[w:I Ching hexagram 01#Hexagram 1|The first hexagram of the I Ching]] is six solid bars from bottom to top. In [[I Ching]] [[divination]], a value of nine corresponds to a solid bar (old [[yang]]: i.e. [[yang]] changing into [[yin]]). In the [[w:I Ching|I Ching]] commentary for [[w:I Ching hexagram 01#Hexagram 1|the first hexagram]] ([[:zh:s:周易/乾|周易/乾]]), it notes that a value of nine in the fifth position (the second bar from the top) has the following meaning:
:* [[飛]][[龍]][[在]][[天]]，[[利]][[見]][[大人]]
:* ''The flying dragon is in the heavens, which helps it to see a great man''
: As a result of the symbolism of the wording in the commentary, this term eventually came to be associated with the [[emperor]].
