===Etymology 1===
Unclear.  Likely theories include:
* May be cognate with {{etyl|ojp|-}}-derived noun {{m|ja|露|tr=tsuyu||dew, dewdrop}}, from the way the rainy season causes everything to be covered in drops that may look like dew.  However, the pitch accent differs, as {{m|ja|露}} has patterns 1 or 2, while {{lang|ja|梅雨}} has pattern 0.
* Alternatively, may be cognate with {{etyl|ojp|-}}-derived verb {{m|ja|熟ゆ|tr=tsuyu||to become ripe|pos=obsolete, replaced by modern form {{m|ja|熟える}} ''tsueru''}}, as plums ripen during the rainy season.  In light of the pitch accent, this derivation appears more likely.

===Etymology 2===
{{ja-kanjitab|ばい|う|yomi=on}}
From {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=はいう'}} compound {{m|zh|梅雨|tr=|lit=plum + rain}}, in poetic reference to the season when plums grow.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>

Alternatively, the {{m|ja|黴雨}} spelling may have been the original spelling.  This is [[homophonous]] in {{etyl|ltc|-}}, and literally means ''mold + rain'', in reference to how moldy things get during this season of constant [[humidity]].<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>
