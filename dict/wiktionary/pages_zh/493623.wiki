# {{lb|ja|part of speech|sort=たどうし}} {{l|en|transitive verb}}

====Usage notes====
The terms {{m|en|transitive}} and {{m|en|intransitive}} are somewhat misleading in reference to Japanese.  The English terms are generally used to refer to the {{l|en|syntax}} or {{l|en|structure}} of a sentence, and whether the verb in the sentence is followed by an object.  The Japanese terms refer to the {{l|en|semantics}} or {{l|en|meaning}} of the verb, and whether the action of that verb is happening to or upon something else.  The Japanese term {{m|ja|自動詞|tr=jidōshi}} literally means “self-acting word”, and {{m|ja|他動詞|tr=tadōshi}} literally means “other-acting word”, in reference to this semantic consideration.

For instance, in English, the verb ''ate'' in the simple sentence ''“I ate”'' would be considered an {{l|en|intransitive}} verb, because it is not followed by an object.

However, in the corresponding Japanese, the verb {{m|ja|食べた|tr=tabeta||ate}} in the simple sentence {{lang|ja|私は食べた。}} (''“Watashi wa tabeta.”'') would ''not'' be considered a {{lang|ja|自動詞}} (''jidōshi''), but would instead be considered a {{m|ja|他動詞|tr=tadōshi|pos=literally “other-acting word”}}, as the underlying semantics or meaning of the verb {{m|ja|食べる|tr=taberu||to eat}} conceptually require an object: when one ''eats'', one eats ''something'', even if left unstated.

This semantic focus is the underlying mechanism by which verbs in sentences like {{lang|ja|私は食べた。}} (''Watashi wa tabeta.'' - “I ate.”) are still considered {{m|ja|他動詞|tr=tadōshi|pos=glossed as “{{l|en|transitive}}”}} even when there is no stated object (because the fundamental meaning of the verb implies action by the subject upon something else), and verbs in sentences like {{lang|ja|道を歩く。}} (''Michi o aruku.'' - “[I] walk the street.”) are still considered {{m|ja|自動詞|tr=jidōshi|pos=glossed as “{{l|en|intransitive}}”}} even when there is an explicit object marked with the object or accusative particle {{m|ja|を|tr=o}} (because the fundamental meaning of the verb only implies action by the subject itself in a way that does not affect the noun marked by {{m|ja|を}}).
