{{zh-x|漢 時 名節 骨鯁 士，同心 愛國，而 宦官 小人 疾 之，起 黨錮 之 獄，訖 亡 天下。趨利 之 人，常 為 朋比，同 其 私 也；守正 之 人，常 遭 構毀，違 其 私 也。|During the Han dynasty, righteous officials were one-minded and patriotic, but they were hated by the vile eunuchs, who set up the [[w:Disasters of the Partisan Prohibitions|partisan prohibitions]] to end their regime. Those who sought after profit often ganged up because of their common selfishness, while the upright often fell into their snares.|CL}}
