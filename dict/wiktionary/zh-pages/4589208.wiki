# {{lb|zh|computing}} [[memory]]; [[storage]]
{{attention|zh|Does this really mean both computing sense "memory" and "storage"? In English those two terms are opposed. "Memory" means [[RAM]], temporary storage used by running software to perform its functions, whereas "storage" is an umbrella term to cover long-term storage such as hard drives and SSD's which are used to store the software itself and the data such as file and folders.}}
