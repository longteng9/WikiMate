==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|よ|ろ|し|く}}

===Etymology===
[[eye dialect|Eye dialect]] for {{m|ja|宜しく|tr=yoroshiku||well}}. The kanji are used phonetically. This use grew out of the practices of biker gangs, who would use kanji in creative ways, possibly for the [[irony]], as biker gang members have generally been regarded as low class and uneducated, while knowing how to read and write kanji is generally a mark of education and refinement.

===Interjection===

# {{eye dialect of|lang=ja|sort=よろしく|nodot=1|宜しく}} (''yoroshiku'', “well”), the adverbial form of {{m|ja|宜しい|tr=yoroshii||good}}.

====Usage notes====
In general usage, ''yoroshiku'' is used in parting as a request (short for {{ja-r|宜しくお願いします|よろしく おねがい します}}) that the addressee think well of the speaker. Some sub-cultures have taken to using the term as a greeting instead. The {{lang|ja|夜露死苦}} spelling as used by such sub-cultures would thus be a greeting, similar to ''[[good morning]]''.
