===Etymology===
Compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=はっぽうしゅ|発泡|tr1=happō|t1=foaming, bubbling|酒|tr2=shu|t2=alcohol, alcoholic beverage}}.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

The term became more widely used following changes in the Japanese tax code in the 1990s that levied higher taxes on beer made with higher percentages of [[malt]]. See [[w:Happoshu|the Wikipedia article]] for more details.

===Noun===
{{ja-noun|はっぽうしゅ}}

# a [[beer]] made with less [[malt]] by weight than the percentage required to be officially labelled as “beer”, as defined by the Japanese tax code (and thus avoiding the higher taxes on official “beer”)
#: ''Happōshu'' can be made with [[malt]] levels of 0% to 24% of the total [[fermentable]] ingredients by weight. Sometimes equated with {{m|en|alcopop}}, although ''happōshu'' is more specific, as ''happōshu'' is generally intended to at least [[resemble]] beer.
