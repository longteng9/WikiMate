===Etymology===
[[青]] ([[green]]) + [[史]] ([[history]])
: In ancient times, bamboo strips were sewn together to form books. The books were used to record events. Each strip would contain a single column of characters. The "green" in the word refers to the fact that the bamboo strips are green before they are cured and sewn into books. Later on, this word simply came to refer generically to history books.
