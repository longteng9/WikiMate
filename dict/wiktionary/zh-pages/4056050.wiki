{{ja-kanjitab|せつ|く|k1=せっ|yomi=o}}

===Etymology===
Appears to be a {{etyl|ja|-}} coinage using {{etyl|ltc|-}}-derived components, possibly derived as a [[portmanteau]] or [[contraction]] from {{m|ja|節|tr=setsu||season}} + {{m|ja|供御|tr=kugo||offering of food or drink}}.  Compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=せっく|節|tr1=setsu|t1=season|供|tr2=ku|t2=offering}}, in reference to [[offering]]s of [[food]] and [[drink]] made by the [[nobility]] to [[shrine]]s and [[temple]]s for the [[seasonal]] [[celebration]]s.

The use of {{m|ja|句}} to spell the ''ku'' portion is an example of [[ateji]].
