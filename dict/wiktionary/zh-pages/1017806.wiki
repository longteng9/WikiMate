===Etymology===
Originally a compound of {{compound|lang=ja|sort=あわもり|粟|tr1=awa|t1=millet|盛|tr2=mori|t2=lots of, pile of, ample portion of}}. ''Awamori'' was originally made primarily from [[millet]].<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

The current spelling using {{m|ja|泡||bubble}} for the ''awa'' portion is an example of [[ateji]], possibly reflecting the change in ingredients from millet to rice.

===Noun===
{{ja-noun|あわもり}}

# [[awamori]], a kind of rice [[whiskey]]
#: ''Awamori'' is an [[alcoholic]] [[beverage]] [[indigenous]] to [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]], also produced somewhat in [[Kyushu]]. Much as [[beer]] is made by [[ferment]]ing [[barley]], and [[whiskey]] is made by [[distil]]ling that [[fermentation]], so is [[sake]] made by fermenting [[rice]], and ''awamori'' is made by distilling that fermentation. Similar to {{ja-l|焼酎||shōchū}}, but typically stronger -- while ''shōchū'' is usually around 24-25% alcohol, traditional ''awamori'' is more commonly 30-40%, or even stronger.
