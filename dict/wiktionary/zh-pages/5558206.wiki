Jocular approximation of {{der|cmn|yue|-}} {{zh-l|[[好]][[犀利]]|tr=hou2 sai1 lei6|so impressive}} in Mandarin.

Originated in an online post by a young female with the pseudonym of {{lang|zh|猴賽雷}} who was soliciting for a boyfriend. Her pseudonym was used to ridicule the exorbitantly stringent criteria she listed in the post, and it subsequently spread as a netizen meme since the start of 2016 as it is the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar.
