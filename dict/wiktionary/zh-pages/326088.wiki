When he was not that old, Elder Princess Liu Piao<ref>[[w:Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu of Han]]'s aunt</ref> sat him on her knee and asked, "Would you like to have a wife?" The Prince of Jiaodong said, "Yes, I would like a wife." Elder Princess pointed to the hundreds of attendants on her left and right, but the prince said no to all of them. The last one she pointed to was her own daughter, "Is A-Jiao<ref>[[w:Empress Chen Jiao|Empress Chen Jiao]], the daughter of Princess Liu Piao (A-Jiao is informal, similar to how we say Suzy instead of Susan in English)</ref> alright?" asked the Elder Princess. The Prince smiled and said, "Good! If I can have A-'''Jiao''' for my wife, I should build a '''golden house''' where I may '''keep''' her.'' (Wiktionary translation)
