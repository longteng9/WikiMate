# creator, maker, originator

=====Usage notes=====
Used only for something new, cannot mean e.g. a maker of new cars because cars already exist. The divine or complete is not necessary, however, an innovation is. For maker of new objects of already existing things, [[製造者]] or other terms are used instead.
