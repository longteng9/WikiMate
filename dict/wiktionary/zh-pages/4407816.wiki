===Etymology===
Contrary to popular belief, the term "Semu" (interpreted literally as "color-eye") did not imply that caste members had "colored eyes" in contrast with brown-eyed Mongol Yuan people. It in fact meant "assorted categories" ([[各色名目]], gè sè míng mù), emphasizing the ethnic diversity of Semu people.
