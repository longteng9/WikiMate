===Etymology===
{{m|ja|sc=Jpan|八紘|tr=hakkō||eight corners}} + {{m|ja|sc=Jpan|一宇|tr=ichiu||one roof}} [[≅]] “the eight corners of the earth [united] under a single roof”

The concept originates from a passage in the [[w:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]] (720): 兼六合以開都、 掩八紘一而為宇, in which [[w:Emperor Jimmu|Emperor Jimmu]] declares [[w:Kashihara, Nara|Kashihara]] to be the capital of the lands. Originally limited to context of Japan as a whole, but in 1903 [[w:Tanaka Chigaku|Tanaka Chigaku]] first used it in reference to world unification. Widely used around 1937 during the [[w:Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the phrase was later included in the July 26, 1940 national policy known as ''Kihon Kokusaku Yōkō'' ([[:ja:w:基本国策要綱|基本国策要綱]]) during the [[w:Fumimaro Konoe|Fumimaro Konoe]] administration.
