{{wikipedia|lang=zh}}

===Etymology===
{{zh-psm|AIDS}} + {{zh-l|病|disease}}.

This is the original translation of “AIDS”. In Mainland China, AIDS has been renamed to “{{zh-l|*艾滋病}}” and the use of this term is discouraged, due to its allegedly incorrect and potentially discriminatory connotation of “HIV/AIDS being transmitted by sexual contact (only)”.
