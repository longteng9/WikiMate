# {{lb|ja|part of speech|sort=けいようどうし}} specific to Japanese grammar, an [[adjective]] with an [[attributive]] form that ends in {{ja-l|な||-na}}

====Usage notes====
English-language labels for this part of speech are various, and include ''adjective'', ''adjectival noun'', the literal translation of ''adjectival verb'', ''copular noun'', ''"-na" adjective'', and ''quasi-adjective''.

Although this term contains the word {{m|ja|動詞|tr=dōshi||verb}} and some sources compare them to verbs, some people feel that there is nothing intrinsically verb-like about these words in the modern language. Historically, this appellation probably arose due to certain inflectionary endings that derived from verbs, such as {{m|ja|なる|tr=naru|pos=homophonic with ''naru'' "to become", but actually derived as a contraction of ''ni aru'' "to be (in a certain state)"}}.

Japanese has three classes of words that correspond to adjectives in English: {{lang|ja|形容動詞}} (''keiyō dōshi''), {{m|ja|形容詞|tr=keiyōshi}}, and {{m|ja|連体詞|tr=rentaishi}}. There are no generally accepted English translations for these parts of speech, and varying texts adopt different translations. Note that some western texts call {{m|ja|形容詞|tr=keiyōshi}} "adjectival verbs", so take caution when using the literal translation of {{lang|ja|形容動詞}} (''keiyō dōshi'').

In more practical and less academic texts, all three of these parts of speech are broadly called “adjectives”, with explanations given for how each type functions.
