===Usage notes===
In [[s:Romance of the Three Kingdoms/Chapter 13#30|Romance of the Three Kingdoms/Chapter 13]], Li Yue loses a battle against [[w:Guo Si|Guo Si]] at Weiyang. However, [[w:Records of Three Kingdoms|Records of Three Kingdoms]] describes the same episode as having taken place in [[w:Shan County, Henan|Caoyang]] ([[曹陽]] - [[southwest]] of present day [[w:Shan County, Henan|Shan County, Henan]]). Therefore, it is now generally thought that "Weiyang" may have actually been a copy error.
