#*:: ''From the beginning of history, the Chinese people have chosen to fight back when in dire circumstances. They persist as if duty-bound not to turn back. It is a tireless seeking spirit that forms a kind of positive resolve where one says, "'''I will not give up hope until I reach the Yellow River'''," or "I have not truly lived until I have reached the Great Wall.''
