===Etymology===
An imported word from the {{w|Western Regions}}, derived from a word in a source languages meaning “lion”.

The use of {{och-l|狻猊|tr=*swar ŋe}} possibly predates that of {{och-l|獅|lion}} and the two are undoubtedly related. Compare {{cog|kho|sarau||lion}}. {{zh-ref|Bailey (1979)}}:

:[[Sogdian]] of the Buddhist texts ''šrγω'', gen. sing. ''šrγωy''. Sogdian of the Manichean texts ''šrωγ'', Middle Parthian of Turfan ''šgr'', ''šgr-z‘dg'' (“cub of lion”). Middle Persian {{m|pal|šgl|šgr}} ... Here ''sarau'' is from *''sarāva-'' but, since ''-g-'' is absent in ''mura-'' 'bird' < ''mr̥ga-'', it would be possible to trace ''sarau'' to *''sargāva-'' and so to base ''sar-g-'', as for Sogdian and M.Parthian.
