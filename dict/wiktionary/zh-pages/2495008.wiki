{{also|竹昇}}
==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=竹升|t2=竹昇|lit=bamboo rise}}
{{wikipedia|lang=zh}}

===Etymology===
Cantonese. Originally as {{zh-l|竹竿|zuk1 gon1|bamboo pole}}: “bamboo pole” > “Chinese person raised overseas” (the inside is hollow like bamboo poles, signifying the lack of Chinese culture in their knowledge).

The word was changed to {{lang|zh|竹升}} (“bamboo rise”) for taboo reasons, since {{zh-l|竿|gon1|pole}} and {{zh-l|降|gong3|to reduce; to lower}} sound alike in Cantonese.
