# {{lb|zh|zoology}} [[looper]], [[inchworm]], [[measuring worm]]
#* {{zh-x|尺蠖 之 屈，以 求 信 也。龍蛇 之 蟄，以 存 身 也。精 義 入 神，以 致 用 也。利 用 安 身，以 崇 德 也。過 此 以往，未 之 或 知 也。窮神 知化，德 之 盛 也。|When the '''looper''' coils itself up, it thereby straightens itself again; when worms and snakes go into the state of hybernation, they thereby keep themselves alive. (So), when we minutely investigate the nature and reasons (of things), till we have entered into the inscrutable and spirit-like in them, we attain to the largest practical application of them; when that application becomes the quickest and readiest, and all personal restfulness is secured, our virtue is thereby exalted. Going on beyond this, we reach a point which it is hardly possible to know. We have thoroughly comprehended the inscrutable and spirit-like, and know the processes of transformation; - this is the fulness of virtue.|CL|ref=Yijing}}
