Laugh not that the wine, placed on the altar by farming families at the end of Lunar New Year, is cloudy.

There are plenty of chickens and suckling pigs for the guests at the end of an abundant year.

Over numerous mountains and streams, I had my doubts that I could find the road. （''or'' The mountains run bare, the streams run dry, and I doubt there is a road ahead)

Then out of the '''shade of the willows, came bright flowers and another village'''.

The sound of [[w:Xiao (flute)|flutes]] and drums grow stronger as I approach the springtime commune.

Their clothing is plain, preserving an ancient quality.

And now, I am able to relax in all of this moonlight,

I will walk with my cane, and knock on every door throughout the night.
