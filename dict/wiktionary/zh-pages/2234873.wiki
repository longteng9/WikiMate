===Etymology===
May be the transcription of a native non-Chinese word.

Alternatively, the name may be derived from its status as the new capital of [[w:State of Shu|Shu]] under the ninth king of its Kaiming dynasty, supposedly in homage to [[w:King Tai of Zhou|King Tai]] of [[w:Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]'s statement that a new settlement needed one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis ({{l|zh|[[一]][[年]][[而]][[所]][[居]][[成]][[聚]]，[[二]][[年]][[成]][[邑]]，[[三]][[年]][[成]][[都]]}}).
