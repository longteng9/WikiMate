====Usage notes====
* In China the pronunciation "jiàomǔ" is generally taught as the only correct reading in Mandarin, however "xiàomǔ" may be heard from time to time, likely {{w|Youbian dubian|by analogy}} with {{zh-l|孝}}. Pronouncing as xiàomǔ in formal situations would be regarded as an indication of the low educational level of the speaker.
