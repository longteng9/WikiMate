===Etymology===
[[且]] (just) + [[聽]] (listen to) [[下回]] (next chapter) + [[分解]] (for an explanation)
: In classical literature, a minor variant of this phrase ([[看]] instead of [[聼]], which changes the meaning to "read" rather than "listen to") was frequently employed as a literary device at the end of a chapter ([[回]]) in order to indicate to the user that there was more to the plot, and that the reader should continue on to the next chapter in order to find out what happened. The modified phrase later became popular during the days of radio broadcasts.
