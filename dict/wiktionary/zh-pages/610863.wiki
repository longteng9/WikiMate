:: ''There was a man from the state of [[w:Chu (state)|Chu]] who was crossing a river. His sword fell from the boat into the river. He quickly made a [[notch]] on the boat saying, "This is the place where my sword fell in. When the boat stops, I will go into the water and search for my sword from the spot where I made the notch." The boat was already moving, but the sword had not moved. Is it not stupid to search for the sword in this manner?''
