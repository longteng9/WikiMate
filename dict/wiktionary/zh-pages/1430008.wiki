{{zh-forms|s=节钺}}

===Etymology===
The tally ({{zh-l|符節}}) was usually made from bamboo, wood, jade or copper. Characters were inscribed on it, and the tally was split into two halves. When using the tally as an instrument of authority, the two halves were joined together in order to prove the authenticity of the person's credentials. The tally and battle-axe ({{zh-l|斧鉞}}) were given to military generals in order to confer imperial authority and legitimacy. If the emperor granted an individual the right to carry a tally, that individual was empowered, among other things, to execute anyone who violated military orders. If the emperor granted someone the right to carry the yellow battle-axe, that person was authorized to command armies both at home and abroad.
