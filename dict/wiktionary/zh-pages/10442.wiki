===Alternative forms===
* [[〆]]

===Etymology===
Japanese kokuji ([[国字]]). From {{m|ja|占める|tr=shimeru}}, as cursive form of top component ト (also [[〆]]). Then applied to other kanji of the same pronunciation, namely 締め, 閉め, 絞め, and 搾め, all pronounced しめ ''shime.'' Sense of “closed, fastened” is due to {{m|ja|閉める||to close|tr=shimeru}} and {{m|ja|締める||to fasten|tr=shimeru}}.

===Kanji===
{{ja-kanji|grade=uc|rs=丿01}}

# "letter closed" character (from 閉める, ''close'')
# [[sum]] (from 〆高, [[締高]], ''sum'')
# [[measurement]] of [[paper]]
# [[bundle]] (from [[締める]], ''fasten'')

====Usage notes====
〆 is primarily used as an abbreviation for 締め, most commonly in {{m|ja|〆切}}, as an abbreviation for {{m|ja|締切||deadline; locked (door)|tr=shimekiri}}, also 締める (〆る) and [[締高]] (〆高). It is also sometimes used for 閉め, notably in sense of “closed envelope”. Even more rarely, it is used to abbreviate other kanji, including 絞め, 占め, and 搾め, as in 〆粕, (from {{m|ja|搾め糟|tr=しめかす}}). There is also occasional use of 乄, as in 乄高.
