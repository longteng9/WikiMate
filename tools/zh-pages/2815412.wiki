# super express (very rapid transportation, particularly of trains)

====Usage notes====
Used until 1972 for the [[w:Hikari (train)|Hikari]] service (fastest service at time) on the [[shinkansen]], the Japanese term has been retired – all shinkansen service is officially [[特急]] – but the English translation “super express” is used in English-language shinkansen announcements.
