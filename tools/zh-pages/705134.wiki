===Etymology===
In the Han Dynasty, a [[Marquis]] was expected to pay an annual tribute of gold to the emperor, which was to be used toward the ritual sacrifices to the gods and ancestors. Failure to pay this tribute was considered to be an offense meriting the stripping of one's noble rank. This tribute was called 酎金.
