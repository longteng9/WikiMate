===Etymology===
{{Han compound|魚|t1=fish|安|ls=psc|c1=s|c2=p}} – a kind of fish.

Found in ancient Chinese as corruption of {{m|mul|sc=Hani|鰋}} (changing {{m|mul|sc=Hani|匽}} to {{m|mul|sc=Hani|安}}) and originally meaning a kind of [[catfish]]. Later, independently coined in Edo period Japan in word {{m|ja|鮟鱇||monkfish|tr=ankō}} from [[ateji]] {{m|ja|安康|tr=ankō}} by adding the {{m|mul|sc=Hani|魚||fish}} [[radical#Noun|radical]] to each of the ateji characters.<ref>[[w:ja:アンコウ#.E8.AA.9E.E6.BA.90|アンコウ: 語源]], Japanese Wikipedia</ref> As found in Chinese, not considered a Japanese [[kokuji]] coinage, though {{m|ja|鱇}} is kokuji, as it is not found in Chinese. Subsequently borrowed into Chinese from Japanese, both in compound {{m|zh|sc=Hani|鮟鱇}}<ref>[http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/黄鮟鱇/1405301 黄鮟鱇], NCIKU dictionary</ref> and as isolated {{m|zh|sc=Hani|鮟}}.<ref>[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?wdqb=鮟 鮟], MDBG dictionary</ref>
