===Etymology 1===
{{zh-compound|唐|山|{{w|Tang Dynasty}}|mountain}}. Many overseas Chinese think of the mainland as an unfathomably tall mountain, as a majority of them come from southern China, where it is lower in altitude compared to further into the mainland. They also connected the physical height of the mountains to the Tang Dynasty, when Chinese history was at its peak.
