==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|曾|祖|伯|父}}

===Etymology===
The word is a composite of [[大祖父|ōōji]] and [[伯父|oji]].

Historically /ohoohodiwodi/. /h/ was initially realized as [p], and eventually weakened into [ɸ] resulting in *[opoopodiwodi] > [oɸooɸodiwodi]. Intervocalic /h/ [ɸ] regularly weakens leaving [oooodiwodi]. The distinction between /zi/ and /di/ as well as /o/ and /wo/ is lost resulting in /zi/ [d͡ʑi] and [o], respectively, and hence the modern form [oːoːod͡ʑiod͡ʑi].
