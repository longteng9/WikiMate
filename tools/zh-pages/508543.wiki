{{wikipedia|lang=zh}}

===Etymology===
From {{zh-l|麻雀|sparrow}}, with a diminutive suffix {{IPAchar|/ŋ̍/}} (syllabic velar nasal) from some Wu dialect (compare Modern Wenzhou dialect {{IPAchar|/ŋ̍/}}). This suffix then fused with the preceding syllable, and was conserved in the form of a nasal rime {{IPAchar|/-ŋ/}}. As an example compare Modern Shanghai dialect {{zh-l|雀|tr=-}} (''old pron.'': {{IPAchar|/t͡ɕiᴀʔ⁵⁵/}}) + {{IPAchar|/-ŋ̍/}} → {{zh-l|*將|tr=-}} {{IPAchar|/t͡ɕiã⁵³/}}.

The game of ''mahjong'' was called {{zh-l|馬吊}} during the {{w|Ming Dynasty|Ming}} and {{w|Qing Dynasty|Qing}} dynasties, where the second syllable presumably represented a Wu dialectal pronunciation of {{zh-l|鳥}} ("bird", see there for more).
