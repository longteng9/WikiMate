{{ja-kanjitab|たい|ふう|yomi=on}}

===Etymology===
Ultimately from Chinese {{m|zh|大風}}, but precisely how it entered Japanese is unclear.<ref>Tai Whan Kim, ''The Portuguese Element in Japanese: A Critical Survey'' (1976): 16. ''taifū'' 'typhoon' Probably in view of semantic association Dalgado linked the Japanese ''taifū'' with Portuguese ''tufão''. He is uncertain as to the immediate source of the Japanese form. There also exists in Japanese anpother form ''taifūn'', not cited by Dalgado. The history of ''taifū'' and ''taifūn'' is as interesting and intricate as Portuguese ''tufão'' and English ''typhoon'', which underlies Japanese ''taifūn''.</ref> For more, see {{m|en|typhoon}}.
