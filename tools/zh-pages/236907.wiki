===Noun===
{{ja-noun|もくさつ}}

# [[ignoring]] someone's suggestion, opinion, or report.
# keeping a [[contemptuous]] [[silence]]

====Usage notes====
* At the close of [[w:World War II|World War II]], Japanese Premier [[w:Kantaro Suzuki|Kantaro Suzuki]] used this unfortunate choice of words in his reply to the [[U.S.]] demand for Japan's [[unconditional]] [[surrender]] (the [[w:Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Declaration]]). The meaning has a more passive nuance than "ignore" into which it was translated, so it is theorized that the Allies took his response to be more assertive than he intended it to be, and that this translation error was responsible for events that followed.
