{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=k|どんぶり}}
Multiple possible derivations.
* During the [[w:Edo period|Edo period]], restaurants specializing in large portions were called {{m|ja|慳貪屋|tr=kendon'ya}}, from {{m|ja|慳貪|tr=kendon||greedy|pos=in reference to “very hungry”}} + {{m|ja|屋|tr=ya||house, store, restaurant}}. The serving [[bowl]]s were called {{m|ja|慳貪}}{{m|ja|振り}}{{m|ja|鉢|tr=kendon-buri-bachi}}, literally “greedy” + “in that fashion” + “bowl”. The ''ken'' portion was [[elide]]d, producing ''donburi-bachi'', and then the ''-hachi'' was dropped to produce ''donburi''.
* Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, ''donburi'' in reference to “a bowl filled with large amount of food” may be cognate with {{m|ja|どんぶり|tr=donburi}}, an [[onomatopoeia]] of something heavy [[plunk]]ing into deep water, or something big and soft [[plop]]ping down, related to [[onomatopoeia]] {{m|ja|どぶり|tr=doburi}}, {{m|ja|どぶん|tr=dobun}}, {{m|ja|どんぶ|tr=donbu}}, and {{m|ja|どん|tr=don}}, all of generally similar meanings. The food starts with a large portion of rice, also referred to as {{m|ja|丼飯|tr=donburi meshi}}, which could be analyzed as “plopped-down rice”.
: ''Donburi'' is also used to refer to something “rough, approximate, not finely worked”, as in the phrase {{m|ja|丼勘定|tr=donburi kanjō||rough approximation, loose estimate}}. This is consistent with a derivation from the onomatopoeia, but not from the restaurant terms.

The kanji spelling shows {{m|mul|井||a well}} with a dot in the center, possibly indicating something thrown into the well. This could suggest that the {{etyl|ltc|-}} reading {{IPAchar|/təm<sup>X</sup>/}} may similarly derive from [[onomatopoeia]].

====Pronunciation====
{{ja-pron|yomi=k|どんぶり|acc=0|acc_ref=DJR}}

====Noun====
{{ja-noun|どんぶり}}

# a simple large [[bowl]] for serving food
# a one-[[bowl]] [[meal]] served in a [[donburi]] [[bowl]], consisting of a large portion of rice, covered in a [[meat]] or [[fish]]

=====Usage notes=====
To [[disambiguate]], speakers may refer more specifically to ''donburibachi'' for the bowl, and ''donburi mono'' for the food.

English-language sources often refer to the food as similar to [[stew]] served over rice. Note, however, that stews consist of meat, fish, and/or vegetables cooked in a liquid and served with the sauce, whereas donburi [[topping]]s may be relatively dry, as in [[tempura]] donburi or [[beef]] donburi, or even uncooked, as in ''tekkadon'' ([[tuna]] [[sashimi]] donburi).
