{{zh-forms|s=桩脚}}

===Etymology===
* A reference to the [[Min Nan]] term: [[縛]][[柱仔腳]] ([[POJ]]: pa{{lang|und|sc=Latinx|̍}}k thiāu-á-kha, literally: to tie the base of the piles together). The Mandarin equivalent of [[縛]] ([[POJ]]: pa{{lang|und|sc=Latinx|̍}}k, English: to tie, to bind together) is [[綁]], and the Mandarin equivalent of [[柱仔]] ([[POJ]]: thiāu-á, English: stake, pile, post) is [[樁]]. The phrase "to tie together one's base piles" is a metaphor for when a politician earmarks money in a budget in order to benefit key supporters (such as local political leaders, companies with government contracts etc) in return for their political support, either in the form of campaign contributions or votes.
