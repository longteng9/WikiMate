===Etymology===
Mengjin began its life as an ancient ferry crossing for the [[Yellow River]]. According to legend, [[w:King Wu of Zhou|King Wu of Zhou]] crossed the [[Yellow River]] at this location, after forming an alliance ([[盟]]/méng/[[alliance]] + [[津]]/jīn/ferry crossing) with the other nobles. One theory goes that the original name was actually [[盟]][[津]] (literally: the ferry crossing of the alliance) rather than [[孟]][[津]] ([[盟]] and [[孟]] are both rendered as Meng). According to this theory, it was only in later times that the character [[盟]] was mistakenly replaced by [[孟]]. The ferry crossing was an important strategic location during times of war.
