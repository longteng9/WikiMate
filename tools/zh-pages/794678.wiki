# [[forward]]; [[ahead]]

===Usage notes===
This phrase is often used in the construction 向前看 (to look ahead, to look in the forward direction). A common pun in Chinese, which originated during the early period of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, is 向钱看 (to look toward money, to be focused on money), which has an identical pronunciation with this phrase (向前看).
