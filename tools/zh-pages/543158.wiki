===Etymology===
* The Mandarin pronunciation of these two characters approximates the sound of the original [[Min Nan]] word: [[khàu-pē]] ([[哭父]]), lit. ''to mourn the death of one's father''; the phrase is also a crude way to curse someone (i.e. to hope that a person is placed in the position of having to mourn the loss of a parent).
