===Etymology===
From the addition of {{zh-l|秦|Qín}} during the [[Han]] [[dynasty]] to the self-proclaimed title of {{zh-l|始皇帝}}. Owing to the Chinese preference for two- or three-[[character]] names, the title was then contracted. {{rfv-etymology|zh}}

===Proper noun===

# {{lb|zh|historical}} {{w|Qin Shi Huang}}, the first [[emperor]] of [[China]]

====Usage notes====
Although the forms [[First Emperor]], [[Shi Huangdi]], and [[Shih Huang-ti]] remain more common in non-scholarly English, {{lang|zh|秦始皇}} is much more common in modern Chinese, with the non-truncated forms only appearing in scholarly or historical works.

The [[personal name]]s 嬴政 and the rare [[hypercorrection]]s {{zh-l|趙政}} are [[anachronism]]s: Chinese of the period generally employed their [[姓]] ([[ancestral name]]s), [[氏]] ([[clan name]]s), and [[名]] ([[given name]]s) separately and not in the compound form of modern Chinese.

====Synonyms====
* {{zh-l|秦始皇帝}}
* {{zh-l|始皇帝}}
