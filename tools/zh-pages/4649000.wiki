==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|ろ|かい|yomi=o}}

===Etymology===
{{IPAchar|/roe/}} → {{IPAchar|/rokwai/}} → {{IPAchar|/rokai/}}

Originally a {{borrowing|ja|nocap=1|la|aloe}}.

During the {{w|Edo period}}, this plant was known in Japan as ''roe'', as an abbreviation of the Latin-derived genus name {{m|mul|Aloe}}.

The kanji spelling is {{ateji|sort=ろかい}}, based on the borrowed reading of ''e'' for {{m|ja|薈|pos=official [[音読み#Japanese|on'yomi]] of ''wai'' and ''kai'', historical ''kwai''}}, based on the [[呉音#Japanese|goon]] reading of ''e'' for separate character {{m|ja|會}}, the lower portion of the {{m|ja|薈}} character (and the traditional form of modern {{m|ja|会}}).  Over time, the irregular ''e'' reading reverted to the then-official ''kwai'' reading, which then shifted to produce modern ''rokai''.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>
