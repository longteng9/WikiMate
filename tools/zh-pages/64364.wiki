===Etymology===
{{IPAchar|/yamato<sub>2</sub>/}}: {{IPAchar|[jamatə]}} → {{IPAchar|[jamato]}}

From older {{m|ja|邪馬台|tr=yamatai}}. Originally a geographical region in [[w:Nara Prefecture|Nara]], came to refer to all of Nara, and eventually to the country as a whole: Japan.

Chinese texts often used the word {{m|zh|倭||dwarf, midget}} to refer to the people of the Japanese archipelago, possibly because they were actually smaller, or more likely as an insult. This character came to be used in early Japanese texts, such as the [[w:Man'yōshū|''Man'yōshū'']] poetry compilation, with a [[訓読み#Japanese|kun'yomi]] or native-Japanese reading of ''Yamato'' to refer to Japan in general.

This {{ja-l|倭}} character also has an [[音読み#Japanese|on'yomi]] or borrowed Chinese reading of ''wa''. During the reign of [[w:Empress Genmei|Empress Genmei]] (707–715), the {{ja-l|倭}} character with an original Chinese meaning of “midget, dwarf” was replaced with the {{ja-l|和}} character that is also read ''wa'', but instead has the more positive meaning of “harmony”, in spellings of the native Japanese term ''Yamato''. The {{ja-l|和}} character also has a [[訓読み#Japanese|kun'yomi]] of ''yawa'', which would have been ''yaba'' in ancient times, suggesting another possible phonetic reason to use {{ja-l|和}} to spell ''Yamato'' (on a softening of the “b”: ''yaba'' → ''yama''). The {{ja-l|大}} character meaning “great” was then prefixed to this.<ref name="DJS">{{R:Daijisen}}</ref> The resulting kanji compound {{lang|ja|大和}} can also be read with a [[訓読み#Japanese|kun'yomi]] of ''Ōyamato''.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>
