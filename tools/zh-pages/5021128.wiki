{{ja-kanjitab|じき|ひつ|yomi=on}}
* {{IPAchar|/dikipitu/}} → {{IPAchar|/dikifitu/}} → {{IPAchar|/d͡ʑikihit͡su/}}

From {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=じきひつ}} compound {{m|zh|直筆|tr=drik pit|lit=straight, direct + writing}}.  Compare modern {{etyl|cmn|-}} {{zh-l|直筆|tr=zhíbǐ|an honest story, a straightforward account of something}}.

This reading uses the [[呉音#Japanese|goon]] of ''jiki'' for the first character and the [[漢音#Japanese|kan'on]] of ''hitsu'' for the second character, possibly suggesting an innovation in the reading within Japanese after the initial borrowing.

# the resulting [[handwritten]] [[document]] or writing:
## one's own [[handwriting]]
## a [[holograph]], an [[autograph]] {{qualifier|something written by oneself, not just one's signature}}

===Etymology 2===
{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=o|ちょく|ひつ}}
From {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=ちょくひつ}} compound {{m|zh|直筆|tr=drik pit|lit=straight, direct + writing}}.  Compare modern {{etyl|cmn|-}} {{zh-l|直筆|tr=zhíbǐ|an honest story, a straightforward account of something}}.

This reading uses the [[漢音#Japanese|kan'on]] for both characters, suggesting either a later borrowing of the term as a whole, or a shift in reading influenced by other later borrowings.
