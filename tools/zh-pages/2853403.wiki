==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|えい|ぎょう|ちゅう|yomi=on}}

===Etymology===
{{suffix|営業|中|lang=ja|t1=sales|t2=in the process of|sort=えいぎょうちゅう}}

{{ja-noun|えいぎょうちゅう}}

# open (a store, shop, or restaurant)

====Synonyms====
* {{l|ja|商い中}}

====Antonyms====
* {{l|ja|準備中}}

====Usage notes====
This is often printed on signs hanging at the entrance of a shop or restaurant and is shown when the store is open. The reverse says {{l|ja|準備中}}. These signs are the Japanese equivalent of the English signs saying (Come in we're) open/(Sorry we're) closed.

This word is much more common than the synonym {{l|ja|商い中}} which is used for the same purpose.
