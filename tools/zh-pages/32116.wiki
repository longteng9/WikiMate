===Etymology 1===
<div style="float:right;">
{{wikipedia|lang=ja|アユ|鮎}}
{{wikipedia|Ayu}}
[[File:Ayu_no_Shioyaki.jpg|thumb|250px|{{lang|ja|鮎}} (''ayu'', ''ai''): the '''[[ayu]]''' or '''[[sweetfish]]'''.]]
</div>
{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=k|あゆ}}
Uncertain.
* One commonly encountered etymology suggests that ''ayu'' may derive from {{m|ja|饗|tr=ae||hosting someone to a meal}}, in reference to the way that this fish may be used in Shinto [[offering]]s.<ref name="ateji"/> However, this would have been pronounced ''ape'' in ancient times, and while this ''ape'' did later become ''ahe'', and a shift from ''-he'' to ''-ye'' did occur in many terms during the {{w|Muromachi period}}<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>, the word ''ayu'' in reference to the fish appeared in the ''{{w|Man'yōshū}}'' dating to the late 700s at the latest, and is thus too old for this shift to have occurred.
* Another common etymology states that ''ayu'' may be from extinct {{etyl|ojp|ja|sort=あゆ}} term {{m|ja|落ゆ|tr=ayu||to fall, as nuts from a tree; to flow down, as liquid in a stream}}, in reference to the way that ''ayu'' swim downstream to [[spawn]] in the [[autumn]].<ref name="ateji">'''1988''': あて字のおもしろ雑学 (''Interesting Ateji Trivia'', in Japanese), Freelance Trivia Writers, p.46, Nagaokashoten, Ltd.</ref> Some references<ref>Gogen Allguide, http://gogen-allguide.com/a/ayu_sakana.html</ref> suggest that this is not very eventful and that this etymology is therefore unlikely. However, there are terms specific to the ''ayu'' downstream migration, such as {{m|ja|落鮎|tr=ochiayu||''ayu'' migrating downstream to spawn}} and {{m|ja|鮎落つ|tr=ayuotsu||''ayu'' migrating downstream to spawn}}, suggesting that this event has been culturally important enough that the {{m|ja|落ゆ|tr=ayu}} derivation may be [[plausible]].
* Alternatively, this term may be borrowed from {{etyl|ain|ja|sort=あゆ}} {{m|ain|アイ|tr=ay||arrow}} in reference to how fast the fish moves. See also obsolete Japanese reading ''ai'' below.

The kanji spelling {{lang|ja|鮎}} in reference to [[sweetfish]] is specific to Japan, probably in reference to the way the fish ({{ja-l|魚}}) stakes out its territory ({{ja-l|占}}). There is another tale wherein {{w|Empress Jingū}} caught an ''ayu'' and thereby prophesied (also spelled {{ja-l|占}}) the outcome of a battle, but this is likely a [[folk etymology]]. In China and elsewhere, the {{lang|ja|鮎}} character refers instead to [[catfish]].<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

The kanji spelling {{ja-l|年魚}} is in reference to the common one-year lifespan of this fish.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>

The kanji spelling {{ja-l|香魚}} is in reference to its sweet-tasting flesh.<ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>

====Alternative forms====
