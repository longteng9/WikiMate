===Etymology===
Unknown. The kanji spelling appears to be [[ateji]], which would normally be read as ''tsukimizato'' (“moon-view village”).

One possible derivation suggests that this comes from an old alternate name for the village of Yamanashi in [[w:Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka Prefecture]] (spelled {{ja-l|山梨}}; annexed into the city of [[w:Fukuroi,_Shizuoka|Fukuroi]] in 1963), such that the old spelling was used for the new name. However, this explanation is probably [[apocryphal]].

An alternative explanation is that the spelling is an old pun.  The area around Yamanashi village is relatively flat, and the story goes that the reading ''yama nashi'' originally meant {{m|ja|山|tr=yama||mountains}} + {{m|ja|無し|tr=nashi||without, lacking, none}}.  The spelling {{lang|ja|月見里}} apparently was in reference to the unobstructed view of the moon.<ref name="tokai">{{cite-web

* {{ja-usex|都をば／今は遥かに／遠江／／月の隈なき／'''月見里'''郷|みやこ を ば ／ いま は はるか に ／ とうとうみ ／／ つき の くま なき ／ '''やまなし''' の さと|Leaving the city now far behind; the distant shallows // '''Yamanashi''' village, with nothing to shade the moon}}
