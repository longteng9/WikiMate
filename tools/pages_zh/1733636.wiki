===Etymology===
The name of a character in the fifth volume, 湯問 or "The Questions of Tang", of the Chinese Daoist text 列子 or ''{{w|Liezi}}''. The name literally means "[[stupid]] and [[common]]". In the story, two large mountains stand before the character's house, impeding access, so the character and his family begin moving the mountains. 　A different character portrayed as a clever wag derides the family for their foolishness in moving the mountains instead of their house, but the emperor hears about them and is so impressed with their ambition and dedication that he arranges to have the mountains moved.
