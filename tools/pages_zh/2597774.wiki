===Etymology===
Duke Huan of [[w:Lu (state)|Lu]] (711 BCE - 694 BCE) had four sons. His oldest son, Duke Zhuang of Lu, succeeded his father. Two of his other three sons were: Shu Ya (叔牙) and Ji You (季友). Both of them became the patriarchs of powerful landlord families that later came to be used as a metaphor for those who monopolize power.
