===Etymology===
Chosen as the name of the {{m|ja|年号|tr=nengō||era}} based on a quote from the {{m|ja|後漢書|tr=Gokanjo||[[w:Book of the Later Han|Book of the Later Han]]}}, Volume 79, Part 2, ''Biographies of Confucian Scholars: Xie Gai'' ({{m|zh|謝該}})<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref> (full Chinese source text [[:s:zh:後漢書/卷79下|here]]):

:: {{lang|zh|故能'''文'''武并用，成长'''久'''之计。}}
:: ''And it could be '''civil''' and military use, as a '''permanent''' solution.''

The {{m|en|civil}} meaning here was likely chosen in reference to overtones of {{m|en|peace}} and {{m|en|culture}}.
