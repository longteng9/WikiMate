===Etymology===
Appears to be originally from {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=けってん}} compound {{m|ltc|缺點|tr=khwet temX||deficient point}}. The Chinese characters {{m|zh|欠}} and {{m|zh|缺}} are synonymous, and the former apparently replaced the latter in Japanese spellings of this term. The {{m|zh|缺}} character is not used in modern Japanese.
