{{ja-kanjitab|げん|き|yomi=on}}

===Etymology===
{{attention|ja|Etymology wrong: the wellness senses and fundamental force senses derived separately. The wellness senses weren't confused with [[減気]], they apparently ''started out'' as [[減気]]. The 元気 spelling for these senses appeared later; quote in the 地蔵菩薩霊験記 from 1033. C.f. Daijirin, Kokugo Dai Jiten.}}
From {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=げんき}} compound {{m|zh|元氣|tr=ngjwon khjɨj<sup>H</sup>|lit=first, fundamental, source + vapor, spirit, energy}}. In Chinese cosmology, this represented the fundamental force that [[permeate]]s all matter and life. Early Japanese borrowed this word and meaning. Later, this spelling was [[conflate]]d with the meaning of [[homophone]] {{m|ja|減気|tr=genki||recovery from illness}}, adding in the modern senses related to {{m|en|healthy}} and {{m|en|wellness}}.
