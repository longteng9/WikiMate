===Etymology===
During the {{w|Han Dynasty}}, the emperor's commode was called {{zh-m|虎子}}. However, the grandfather of {{w|Emperor Gaozu of Tang}} was called {{lang|zh|李虎}} (''Lǐ Hǔ''). Because it was forbidden for common items to contain the {{w|Chinese given name|given names}} of members of the imperial family (see {{w|Naming taboo}}), {{zh-m|虎子|tr=-}} was changed to {{zh-m|馬子}}, which morphed later into {{lang|zh|馬桶}}.
