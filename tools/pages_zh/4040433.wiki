===Alternative forms===
* {{ja-l|八咫の鏡}}

===Etymology===
Phrase consisting of {{compound|ja|八|tr1=ya|t1=[[eight]]|咫|tr2=ata|pos2=an ancient unit of [[circumference]]|の|tr3=no|pos3=possessive particle|鏡|tr4=kagami|t4=[[mirror]]|sort=やたのかがみ}}.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref>

The name is a description of the mirror's size. A circle with a [[diameter]] of one {{m|ja|尺|tr=shaku|pos=ancient [[foot]], unit of [[length]]}} would have a circumference of four [[咫#Japanese|''ata'']]. A circumference of eight ''ata'' would thus mean a mirror with a diameter of two ''shaku''. The ''shaku'' at that time was roughly 23 centimeters, so the mirror would have been roughly 46 centimeters across.

===Pronunciation===
{{ja-pron|やた の かがみ|acc=o|acc_ref=NHK|y=k}}

===Proper noun===
{{ja-pos|proper|やたのかがみ|rom=Yata no Kagami}}

# the "Eight-Hand Mirror", one of the three [[sacred]] treasures comprising the [[w:Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia of Japan]]

====Usage notes====
* The ''ata'' of that time period was around 18 centimeters or 7.25 inches, so note that the {{m|en|hand}} in the English name is not the same as the four-inch unit of measurement.
