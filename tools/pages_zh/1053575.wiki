{{ja-kanjitab}}

===Etymology===
Based on a pun on the term {{m|ja|はっと|tr=hatto||startled, surprised}} written using the [[ateji]] of {{l|ja|八}}{{m|ja|斗|tr=hatto||eight ''to''|pos=where ''to'' is a traditional Japanese unit of volume}}.

Literally, the phrase means "{{m|ja|一||one}} {{m|ja|石|tr=koku}} and {{m|ja|六||six}} {{m|ja|斗|tr=to}}", a measure of volume roughly equivalent to 288 liters. Also equal to 16 {{m|ja|斗|tr=to}}.

Figuratively, refers to seeing something once, being happily surprised and saying {{l|ja|はっと|tr=''hatto''}}, and then seeing it again and saying {{lang|ja|はっと}} once more in disappointment. {{lang|ja|はっと}} twice would be 8 {{l|ja|斗}} + 8 {{l|ja|斗}} = 16 {{l|ja|斗}}, or 1 {{l|ja|石}} and 6 {{l|ja|斗}}.
