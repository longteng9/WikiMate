# A method of writing in [[Min Nan]] in which text is half-[[Hanzi]] and half-[[pe̍h-ōe-jī]] (romanized) (as not all Min Nan words have known or standardized Hanzi). Below is an example where a Min Nan word {{zh-l|𠢕早|tr=gâu-chá|good morning}} is written in three methods:
::* Hanzi: {{lang|zh|𠢕早}}
::* Hàn-lô (mixed): {{lang|nan|gâu-}}{{lang|zh|早}}
::* Pe̍h-ōe-jī: {{lang|nan|gâu-chá}}
