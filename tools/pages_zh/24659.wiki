# Used in the name of a town, ''Pacao zhen'' (舥艚镇) in [[:w:en:Cangnan County|Cangnan County]], Zhejiang. Although in 2011, Pacao Town was administratively merged into the nearby Longgang Town, the name Pacao continues to be locally used. As 舥 is a rare character, the place name is occasionally written with 巴 instead.
