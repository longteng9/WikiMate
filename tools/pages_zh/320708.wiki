*:: ''The marquis of [[w:Jin (state)|Jin]] once again wanted to attack Guo by way of Yu. Gong Zhiqi admonished the duke of Yu, saying, "Guo is exterior to Yu. If Guo should perish, Yu is sure to follow. The road should not be opened for [[w:Jin (state)|Jin]]. Bandits are not to be played with. Once was more than enough, how can you do it a second time? The two sayings, 'The carriage and its steadying poles depend on one another' and ''''When the lips perish, the teeth become cold,'''' both apply to the relationship between Guo and Yu."''
