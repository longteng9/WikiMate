===Etymology 1===
{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=irr|sort=たそがれ}}
Used to be pronounced as ''tasokare'' but in the Edo period (1603 - 1868) this changed to ''tasogare''. The main theory for its derivation is from the expression 誰そ彼 ''tasokare'', which meant something like ‘who is that?’. Since this expression was used at dusk, when it became impossible to discern one another’s faces, it became associated with dusk itself. <ref name="">語源由来辞典 ''Gogenyuraijiten'' http://gogen-allguide.com/ta/tasogare.html</ref> The choice of the [[kanji]] [[compound]] 黄昏 to write this word is an instance of [[熟字訓#Japanese | 熟字訓 (''jukujikun'')]].
