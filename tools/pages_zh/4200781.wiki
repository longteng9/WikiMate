===Etymology===
{{zh-compound|蟾宮|折|桂|Toad Palace; the Moon|[[break off]]|[[osmanthus]]}} The phrase alludes to several Chinese legends: one that credited the [[phase]]s of the [[moon]] to a great osmanthus tree ({{zh-l|桂}}) growing and shedding its leaves and blossoms each month; another granting the [[immortal]] {{w|Chang'e}} an enormous [[mansion]] on the moon ({{zh-l|月宮}}), whose grounds included the tree; another (older than the Chang'e stories) seeing a [[pareidolic]] [[toad]] in the shadows of the [[moon]] and associating the toad with good [[luck]] and [[wealth]] ({{zh-l|金蟾}}). Branches of sweet-smelling blossoms from the tree were thought to (rarely) fall to Earth and grant good luck to whosoever found them. The association with the tests had to do with the holding of the examinations around the time of the blossoming of the osmanthus and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] honoring its connections to the moon and Chang'e.
