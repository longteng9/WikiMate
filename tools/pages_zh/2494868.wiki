{{also|宫保}}
==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=宫保}}

===Etymology===
The archaic usage referred to one of several titles during the [[w:Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[w:Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. However, by the end of the Qing Dynasty, the title was merely honorific and did not necessarily mean that the person had anything to do with tutoring the [[crown prince]]. According to legend, because this title was bestowed upon [[w:Ding Baozhen|Ding Baozhen]], the inventor of [[w:Kung Pao chicken|Kung Pao chicken]], it later came to be used as the name for the dish itself.
