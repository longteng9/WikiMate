{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=on|なん|ばん}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|ltc|ja|sort=なんばん}} compound {{m|ltc|南蠻|tr=nom mæn||southern barbarian}}. Compare modern {{etyl|zh|-}} traditional {{m|zh|南蠻}} and simplified {{m|zh|南蛮|tr=nánmán}}.

In Japan, this originally referred to the [[inhabitant]]s of Southeast Asia, particularly the islands of modern-day Philippines and Indonesia. When the Portuguese and Spanish first made contact in Japan, they came from their colonies in Southeast Asia, and were consequently given the same label of ''nanban''. This usage was initially distinct from the separate label {{m|ja|紅毛|tr=kōmō||red hair}} used for the Dutch. Over time, this distinction became less important, and the term ''nanban'' was used to refer to westerners in general.<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref>
