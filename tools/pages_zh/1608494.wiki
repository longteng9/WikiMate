==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=狗仔队|type=21}}

===Etymology===
Originally [[Hong Kong]] {{etyl|yue|cmn}}. When the word [[paparazzi]] was first introduced to [[Hong Kong]], it was frequently rendered as {{m|en|puppy}} for easier pronunciation, and because puppies follow people around in a similar way to [[paparazzi]]. Later on, {{zh-l|狗仔|gau2 zai2|puppy}} substituted the {{etyl|en|-}} word. Still later, {{zh-l|隊|pack}} was added. The term eventually spread in popularity from Hong Kong to other [[Chinese]] speaking areas, such as the [[PRC]] and [[Taiwan]], where the Mandarin pronunciation of the characters is used.

{{zh-pron
|m=gǒuzǎiduì
|c=gau2 zai2 deoi6-2
|cat=n
}}

===Noun===
{{zh-noun}}
