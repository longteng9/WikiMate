===Etymology===
* From [[耽]] ("covet, enjoy") + [[美]] ("beauty"). Originally coined in Japanese as a translation of "[[aestheticism]]" (equivalent Chinese term: [[唯美]]主义)[http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/140578/m0u/%E8%80%BD%E7%BE%8E/], and was applied in the description of [[BL]]-themed comics since the 1970s which at the time were mostly aesthetic and romantic. The latter meaning was later reintroduced into Chinese (as [[和製漢語]]).
