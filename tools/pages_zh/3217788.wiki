===Etymology===
Possibly a dialectally-preserved disyllabic form of {{zh-l|角}} (jiǎo, OC *''kroːg'', "corner; horn"). Unattested in Old Chinese or Middle Chinese literatures, and its usage seems rather recent. Cognate with {{zh-l|角落}} (jiǎoluò, OC *''kroːg g·raːg'', "corner", attested in ''{{w|Classic of Rites}}''), an emphatic form of {{zh-l|角}} (jiǎo, OC *''kroːg'', "corner; horn"). Many languages exhibit ''k(V)l''- or ''k(V)r''- shapes in roots relating to "corner", "horn" or "crookedness"; compare English {{m|en|corner}} (< L. {{m|la|cornū||horn}}), {{m|en|horn}} (both << PIE *''ḱer''- ("horn")), Russian {{m|ru|угол|sc=Cyrl||corner|tr=úgol}}.

Graphically derived from two different stacking patterns of {{zh-l|日|sun}} and {{zh-l|九|nine}}, with unclear connotations.
