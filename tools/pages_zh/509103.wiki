===Etymology===
The name refers to a type of carrying pole (''dan dan'') that was used by walking [[Peddler|street vendors]] who sold the dish to passers-by. The pole was carried over the shoulder, with two baskets containing noodles and sauce attached at either end. The noodles cost almost nothing, and gradually local people came to call them ''dandan'' noodles. Literally, the name translates as "noodles carried on a pole," but may be better translated as "peddler's noodles."
