# Also known as 'The Three Auspicious Friends', or 'The Three Friends of Winter', is a type of [[planting]] sold at [[New Year]]'s [[time]] in Japan to bring good fortune for the coming year. Shōchikubai means [[pine]] (松, ''[[matsu]]''), [[bamboo]] (竹, ''[[take]]''), and [[plum]] (梅, ''[[ume]]''): The pine represents [[strength]], the bamboo represents [[longevity]], and the plum represents [[beauty]] and [[optimism]]. Their [[arrangement]] together is [[accented]] by a [[dry]] [[riverbed]] of [[white]] [[pebble]]s. Around the New Year, you would see these [[symbol]]s present at [[business]]es, [[department store]]s and [[home]]s across Japan.
