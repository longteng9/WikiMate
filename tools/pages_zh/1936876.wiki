===Etymology===
From an unidentified western language, presumably from some language in the [[Islamosphere]]. Compare Persian {{m|fa|مومیایی|tr=mōmiyāyī, mūmiyāyī||mummy; shilajit}}. Earliest attestation was in {{w|Ming Dynasty}}, see the following quote:

* {{lang|zh|sc=Hani|明‧陶宗儀《輟耕錄‧木乃伊》：“[[回回]]田地有年七八十歲老人，自願捨身濟眾者，絕不飲食，惟澡身啖蜜，經月，便溺皆蜜。既死，國人殮以石棺，仍滿用蜜浸，鐫志歲月於棺蓋，瘞之。俟百年啟封，則蜜劑也……俗曰蜜人，番言'''木乃伊'''。”}}
*: ''Tao Zongyi'' (Ming Dynasty), "''Chuogenglu'' - ''Record after retiring from plowing''", Chapter "Mummies": "''There were men 70 to 80 years of age in Arabia (?) willing to give their bodies to save others. They never ate or drink, only bathed and partook of honey. After a month, their excrement (urine and faeces) consisted of honey only. After they died, their fellow men would place them in stone coffins full of honey in which they macerated. The year and month of deaths were engraved on the coffins and the coffins were buried. After a hundred years the coffins were reopened - a confection of honey had formed. Colloquially people called these '[[mellified]] men', in their native tongue '<b>mu-nai-yi</b>'."

* {{l|zh|木蜜納亦|tr=mùmìnàyì||mummy}}, attested in ''{{w|zh:回回藥方|Huihui Yaofang}}'' (''Islamic Formularies'', ca. 14th century);
* {{l|zh|木蜜亞依|tr=mùmìyàyī}}, attested in ''Mingjing Cidian'' ({{lang|zh|明淨詞典}});
* {{l|zh|木蜜亞|tr=mùmìyà}} (from [[Uyghur]]),

all of which might have referred to {{w|Shilajit}} ({{zh-l|地蠟}}) originally.

{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=irr|sort=みいら}}

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|pt|ja|sort=みいら}} {{m|pt|mirra||myrrh, skeleton, mummy}}<ref name="KDJ">{{R:Kokugo Dai Jiten}}</ref><ref name="DJS">{{R:Daijisen}}</ref><ref name="KJE">{{R:Kojien}}</ref><ref name="DJR">{{R:Daijirin}}</ref> or {{etyl|nl|ja|sort=みいら}} {{m|nl|mirre||myrrh}}.<ref name="KDJ"/>

The kanji spelling {{lang|ja|木乃伊}} is an example of [[熟字訓#Japanese|jukujikun]].  This spelling was borrowed from {{etyl|zh|ja|sort=みいら}} {{m|zh|木乃伊|tr=mùnǎiyī||mummy}}<ref name="KDJ"/><ref name="DJR"/><ref name="DJS"/><ref name="SMK">{{R:Shinmeikai5}}</ref>. Some {{etyl|ja|-}} sources<ref name="KDJ"/><ref name="DJR"/><ref name="DJS"/><ref name="SMK"/> suggest that the {{etyl|zh|-}} term was a transliteration of {{cog|nl|mummie}} (with some stated concern that this derivation is doubtful<ref name="SMK"/>), but it appears that the {{etyl|nl|-}} and {{etyl|zh|-}} terms are unrelated. See [[木乃伊#Chinese|the Chinese entry]] for more.
