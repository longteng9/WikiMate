# The [[traditional]] [[li]] or [[Chinese mile]], a [[traditional]] [[Chinese]] [[unit]] of [[distance]] [[equal]] to 1500 [[chi]] ({{zh-l|市尺}}) or 150 [[zhang]] ({{zh-l|市丈}}), [[standardized]] in 1984 as [[half]] of a [[kilometer]] (500 [[meter]]s).

====Usage notes====
In most contexts, this unit is simply written as {{zh-l|里}}. The form {{lang|zh|市里}} is encountered in modern situations where the writer wishes to be careful to distinguish the traditional li from the {{zh-l|公里}} or [[kilometer]].
