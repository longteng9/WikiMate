{{zh-forms|s=周瑜打黄盖|1=Zhou Yu|3=Huang Gai|type=212|delink=1,3|lit={{w|Zhou Yu}} attacks {{w|Huang Gai}}}}

===Etymology===
From the ''{{w|Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}''. This is the first part of a ''[[xiehouyu]]''. The second part is {{lang|zh|[[一]][[個]][[願]][[打]]，[[一]][[個]][[願]][[挨]]}} (one is willing to give a beating, and one is willing to take a beating). {{w|Zhou Yu}} wanted {{w|Huang Gai}}, his subordinate, to pretend to defect to {{w|Cao Cao}}'s side so that Huang Gai could gain Cao Cao's trust. This allowed Huang Gai to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet during the {{w|Battle of Red Cliffs}}, forcing Cao Cao to retreat. Zhou Yu had Huang Gai flogged in front of Cao Cao's spies so that they would not be suspicious.
