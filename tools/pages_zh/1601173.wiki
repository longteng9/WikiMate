===Etymology===
峨嵋 derives from the word [[蛾眉]] (the feathery feelers of a moth), so named because the peaks of [[w:Mount Emei|Mount Emei]] do in fact resemble the feelers of a moth (see pictures). The "insect" [[w:Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] ([[虫]]) on the left side of the first character [[蛾]] was later replaced with the "mountain" [[w:Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] ([[山]]). Thus, [[蛾]] eventually became [[峨]], so as to denote the mountain. The "mountain" [[w:Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] can be optionally added to the second character [[眉]]. Both 峨嵋 and [[峨眉]] have been used through the centuries.
