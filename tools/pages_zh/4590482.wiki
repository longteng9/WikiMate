===Etymology===
Old Chinese pronunciation was *''to no''. Possibly cognate with {{zh-l|蜘蛛|spider, *''te to''}}, per the dialectal dictionary ''{{w|Fangyan}}'' (1st century {{CE}}):

* {{lang|zh|鼅鼄，鼄蝥也。自關而西，秦晉之間謂之鼄蝥。自關而東，趙魏之郊謂之鼅鼄，或謂之蠾蝓，蠾蝓者侏儒語之轉也。北燕朝鮮洌水之間，謂之蝳蜍。}}
*: ''"<u>Te to</u>", '''spider'''; also called "<u>to mo</u>". To the west of {{w|Hangu Pass}}, in the Qin and Jin regions, it is called "<u>to mo</u>". To the east of the Pass, in the Zhao and Wei regions, it is called "<u>te to</u>", or "<u>to lo</u>". The latter is an alternation of the word "<u>to no</u>" ("dwarf"). In the Northern Yan, Korea, and Lie River regions, it is called "<u>to la</u>".''

Compare the derivation of {{cog|en|midget}} from {{m|en|midge}}.
