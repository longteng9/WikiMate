===Etymology===
The following etymology was provided by [[w:Taiwanese (linguistics)|Taiwanese language]] expert, Professor Dang Hong-Zing ({{lang|zh|董峰政}}, ''POJ'' {{lang|nan|Táng Hong-chèng}}): When [[w:Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]], [[w:Kodama Gentarō|Kodama Gentarō]], then [[w:Governor-General of Taiwan|Governor-General of Taiwan]], became concerned about the spread of infectious diseases. He tasked his head of civilian affairs, [[w:Gotō Shimpei|Gotō Shimpei]], to instruct the public to air their bedding and clean their kitchens at least once a week. After the bedding was aired in the sun, one had to beat it with a stick {{zh-l|拍|tr=phah}}. The verb for cleaning the kitchen was {{zh-l|摒|tr=piàⁿ}}. It became common practice to ask people if they had carried out these two tasks by asking, "Have you '''{{lang|nan|phah-piàⁿ}}''' (''lit.'' beat out your bedding and clean your kitchen) this week?" Since {{zh-l|拼}} and {{zh-l|摒}} are pronounced the same in Min Nan, {{zh-l|拼}} came to be used instead. Eventually, the word came to mean ''to strive'', or ''to work diligently''. Since the equivalent of {{zh-l|拍}} is {{zh-l|打}} in Mandarin, this word is often written as {{zh-l|打拼}}. It is likely that the Mandarin word ''{{lang|cmn|dǎpīn}}'' came from the Min Nan '''{{lang|nan|phah-piàⁿ}}'''.
