==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|家|内}}

===Etymology===
Literally ‘inside the house’ from the Sino-Japanese (on'yomi) readings of
{{m|ja|家||house|tr=か, ka|sc=Jpan}}
+ {{m|ja|内||inside|tr=ない, nai|sc=Jpan}}.

===Noun===
{{ja-noun|かない}}

# {{lb|ja|humble|sort=かない}} (one's own) [[wife]]

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|one’s own wife}} {{qualifier|more gender-neutral}} {{ja-r|妻|つま}}
* {{sense|another’s wife}} {{ja-r|奥さん|おくさん}}

===Usage notes===
* This word should only be used in reference to the speaker’s own wife, whereas {{lang|ja|奥さん}} (okusan) is a polite term used to refer to someone else’s wife.

{{lang|ja|妻}} (tsuma) is a more general term for a wife, and can also mean spouse.

{{lang|ja|家内}} is offensive to some, literally meaning “in the house”, thus carrying connotations of traditional gender roles; in this case, {{lang|ja|妻}} is preferred.
