{{also|垂簾听政|垂帘听政}}
==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=垂簾听政|type=22|lit=to handle matters of state behind a curtain}}

===Etymology===
The idiom arose from a practice in ancient China, by which a royal lady, as an [[empress]] or [[empress dowager]], was allowed to preside over the imperial court without actually being seen by her subjects, because women were prohibited from politics. This would usually be done by the mother of a child emperor.
